        device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect
        and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular
        individual User.
      </p>
      <h3 className="privacy-bold">Cookies and similar technologies:</h3>

        When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information
        about how you use mSeva and provide features to you. We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which
        may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.
      </p>
      <h3 className="privacy-bold">Log file information:</h3>
      <p>
        Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can
        also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.

        the Service.
      </p>
      <h3 className="privacy-bold">Device Identifiers:</h3>
      <p>
        When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or
        remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated
        with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device
        hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by mSeva.
      </p>
      <p>
        A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or
        others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of
        device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
      </p>
      <h3 className="privacy-bold">Metadata:</h3>
      <p>
        Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of
        User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag
        (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive.
        If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable
        (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.
